## hacking

requirements:
+ `make` and a C compiler (`gcc`, `clang`)
+ `dub` and a D compiler (`dmd`, `gdc`, `ldc`)

rengfx depends on raylib (via [dray](https://github.com/xdrie/dray) bindings).
by default, `dray` will run a pre-generate script that automatically builds `raylib`.

build engine:
```sh
dub test # run tests
dub build # build library
```

open docs locally:
```sh
dub run -b ddox
```

run demo:
```sh
cd demo/<name>
dub run # run demo
```
